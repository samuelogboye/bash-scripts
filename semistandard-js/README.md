# Save more time

clone the repo

```bash
git clone https://github.com/samuelogboye/bash-scripts.git
```

cd directly to semistandard-js

```bash
cd bash-scripts/semistandard-js
```

run make
```bash
make
```

This will make the file `js` executable and move to /bin at same time

Everything is now ready

instead of typing `semistandard` simply type `js` (save 10 character stroke styping)

instead of typing `semistandard --fix` simply type `js f` (save 14 characters)



Same error output
Same evrything

You only save more time
